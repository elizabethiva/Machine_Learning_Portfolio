# Shakespearean Sonnet Generation
Shakespearean Sonnet Generation predicts the next word in a text sequence, using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets.
This project has utilized the Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset, encompassing over 2000 lines of text extracted from Shakespeare's sonnets.
Model architecture capable of achieving an accuracy of 84%:

# Sign Language Recognition System
In this project, I tackle a multi-class classification problem by utilizing the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset. The dataset comprises 28x28 images that portray the 26 letters of the English alphabet represented through hand gestures. The primary objective of the project is to create a robust classification model that can accurately categorize each image based on the specific letter it signifies.
Below you can see what the images of the dataset look like.

The model architecture is designed to achieve an accuracy of 92% for both training and validation data.
