# Shakespearean Sonnet Generation
Shakespearean Sonnet Generation predicts the next word in a text sequence, using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets.
This project has utilized the Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset, encompassing over 2000 lines of text extracted from Shakespeare's sonnets.
Model architecture capable of achieving an accuracy of 84%:

# Sign Language Recognition System
In this project, I tackle a multi-class classification problem by utilizing the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset. The dataset comprises 28x28 images that portray the 26 letters of the English alphabet represented through hand gestures. The primary objective of the project is to create a robust classification model that can accurately categorize each image based on the specific letter it signifies.
Below you can see what the images of the dataset look like.

The model architecture is designed to achieve an accuracy of 92% for both training and validation data.

# BBC News Classification
The goal of this project is to build a system capable of accurately classifying previously unseen news articles into the correct category.
In this project, we utilize the [BBC News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview), which comprises 2225 instances of news articles along with their corresponding labels.
The model architecture is designed to achieve an accuracy of 95% for validation data.

# Sunspot Activity Forecasting
This project focuses on measuring and forecasting sunspot activity. Sunspots, dark areas on the sun's surface, are a crucial aspect of solar research and have implications for space weather and terrestrial communications.
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict sunspot activity based on historical data.
The analysis is based on historical data from the [Sunspots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robervalt/sunspots), spanning 272 years (1749-2021) of monthly sunspot counts.
The model leverages convolutional layers followed by stacked LSTMs and dense layers.
The model architecture is designed to achieve a loss of 16.2 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 16.7 when predicting sunspot activity.
