# Shakespearean Sonnet Generation
Shakespearean Sonnet Generation predicts the next word in a text sequence, using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets.
This project has utilized the Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset, encompassing over 2000 lines of text extracted from Shakespeare's sonnets.

# Sign Language Alphabet Classification
In this project, I tackle a multi-class classification problem by utilizing the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset. The dataset comprises 28x28 images that portray the 26 letters of the English alphabet represented through hand gestures. The primary objective of the project is to create a robust classification model that can accurately categorize each image based on the specific letter it signifies.
Below you can see what the images of the dataset look like.
